# Fun-tastic
An end-to-end teaching-learning platform where children will learn from their favorite toons. Teachers can upload their teaching videos which would be animated by the platform and then mapped to the favourite cartoon. The virtual agent in the form of favorite cartoon can also solve children's doubts and curious questions.
